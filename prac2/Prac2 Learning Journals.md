Content Insights

Joomla is a free and open source content management system (CMS) for creating and managing websites. It is developed under the PHP language and uses a MySQL database to store the content of the website. 
Joomla's flexibility makes it suitable for all types of websites, including personal blogs, corporate websites, e-commerce platforms and online communities.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Joomla focuses on user friendliness and provides me with an intuitive management interface that allows me to easily create, edit, and maintain website content without deep technical knowledge.
Extend its functionality by installing Extensions, Templates, Plugins, etc. This allows me to select the appropriate extensions for my specific needs.
Due to its flexibility and scalability, Joomla is suitable for a wide variety of different types of websites, from personal blogs to corporate portals and e-commerce platforms.
