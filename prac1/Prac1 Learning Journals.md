Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing the practical, I started looking at study courses on online sales to see if they gave me more insight I hadn't gotten. 
I did learn some new things, such as some website design ideas, how to give users a very comfortable browsing experience. 
From this strategy to this week's study, I come to the conclusion that my website will become more humanized and more functional through weekly accumulation and modification.
