On the Underscores website, you will see a form. Fill in the relevant information in the form, including the subject name, subject prefix, author, etc. Once generated, the website will provide a ZIP file containing your new theme. Download the ZIP file and unzip it. Once unzipped, you'll get a directory with many files and folders. This is the basic structure of the new theme. Open the theme file with a text editor and modify it according to your needs. You can add custom styles, modify structures, or introduce other features.
