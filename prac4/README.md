I ran into some problems during the installation process. My website reported an error, the error content is mysqli::real_connect(): (HY000/1045): Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO). So I did a Google search found a solution through YouTube videos, and corrected the error by modifying the relevant configuration files. After success, the 4 screenshots have been saved in a Word file. I successfully created the database and WordPress and set up the homepage of WordPress.
